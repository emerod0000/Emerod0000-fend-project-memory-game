## How I built the Memory Game
I created it with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
create a pop-up modal when player wins game
