## How I created the memory game
I created it with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Steps followed  to create the memory game
- I created a deck of cards that shuffles on each play
- I created a moves counter to count the number of moves made by player.
- I added a timer to tell the user the time it takes to finish the game.
- I added a restart feature, if user wants to begin again.
- Everytime a card is matched they will turn green and stay flipped over
- I added a pop-up modal when player matches all the cards.
   - This tells the the number of moves taken, the time and the satr rating they were given.
   - If they press play gain it resets the game.
